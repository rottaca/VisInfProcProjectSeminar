# Visual Information Processing Project Seminar

This Repository contains my code for the Visual Information Processing Project Seminar at University Ulm, Germany.

My tasks were:
- Implement an optic flow estimator by using event-based DVS cameras according to this paper \[1\]. 
- Use the optic flow to control a small robot platform by biological inspired algorithms \[2\].
